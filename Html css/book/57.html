    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk. lying between the copies of
        <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
        thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she
        spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room. sitting under a posture with an oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
        <q>Work is the refuge of people who had nothing better to do.</q> Although many considerd her pioneering work,
        unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an otstanding
        achievement, molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do .
